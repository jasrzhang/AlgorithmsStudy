# Graphs:

Graphs represents relationship between objects
Collection of objects along with pairwise connection between objects


## Terms:
	#### 1. Graph is a collection of object called as Vertices and together with relationship between them called as Edges
		Graph(G) = {V,E}
	#### 2. Each Edge in the Graph joins two vertices
	#### 3. Vertices(V) = {A, B, C ,D}

#### Directed Edge: 
	An **edge(u,v)** is directed if pair (u,v) is ordered, with u preceding v.	Edge is oriented or Direction
#### Undirected Edge: 
	An **edge (u,v)** is undirected if pair (u,v) is not ordered. -> Edge has no orientation
#### Weighted Edge: 
	If a cost or a weight is assigned to an edge, then the edge is known as a **Weighted Edge**. 
#### Weighted Undirected Graph: 
	All edgeds of the undirected graph have weights or costs assgined
#### End Vertices: 
	Two vertices joined by an edge.
#### Adjacent Vertices:  
	Two vertices are adjancent if there is an edge between them.
#### Incident Edge: 
	If vertex is **one** of the end points. 
#### Outgoing Edges: 
	Origin is the vertex
#### Incoming Edges:
	Destination is the vertex
#### Self loop
	**From** and **On** the same vertex
#### Parallel Edges:
	Edge from ** u to v (u,v) ** as well as an edge from ** v to u (v,u) **
